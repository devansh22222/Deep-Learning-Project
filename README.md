Anomaly detection in Network dataset

Network Intrusion dataset(CIC-IDS- 2017)


About Dataset
This is the Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017) you can find the dataset by this link "https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html"

This Network dataset has 2 Class one is Normal and another one is Anomaly ,
These are the things you can try in this data

1) The main aim is detect the anomaly using labelled data
2) Also try to detect the patterns in Normal and anomaly data without using labelled data by unsupervised methods
3) Also try to make a model which detects abnormal behaviour in each system if you can .
